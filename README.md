# DSII-Project-FusionTree

# Introduction
Final Project for the course CS201: Data Structures II offered in Spring 2023 in which we were required to either implement a new data structure not discussed in the course, make comparison between different data structures, or propose and implement our own data structure. We chose to implement a new data structure - Fusion Trees

# Fusion Tree:
A Fusion Tree is a modification of a B-Tree that implements an associative array on $w$-bit integers in a known universe size. An associative array is an abstract data type that stores a collection of pairs such as key-value pair. Fusion Trees are mostly used when our universe size is large, while providing linear - O(n) - space complexity, and O(logn) search time complexity making it faster than a traditional self-balancing tree.
